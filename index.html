discussing compiler construction, programming language design, and
related topics. It takes place about once per month.</p>

<p class="next">The next meetup will take place <u>Tuesday the 7th of August</u>.</p>

<p>We will meet at the <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=soundcloud,+berlin&ll=52.52755,13.402904&spn=0.005855,0.016512&hq=soundcloud,&hnear=Berlin,+Germany&t=v&z=17&iwloc=A">Soundcloud office</a> around 19:00.</p>

<h2>Talks for the next event</h2>

<p>These are planned:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Andr√© van Delft will present a concurrent programming model
  based on an <em>Algebra of Communicating Processes</em>.</li>
  <li><a href="http://marijnhaverbeke.nl">Marijn Haverbeke</a> will,
  if no one else proposes a better talk, give an overview of the Rust
  compiler's internals.</li>
</ul>

<p>Did you study the internals of some compiler or VM? Are you working
on a toy language? Read some mind-blowing papers on a related subject?
Any other war stories to share? Submit a talk! Simply write to the
mailing list with your proposal. We'll schedule it for the next
meeting.</p>
