<h1>The Berlin Compiler Meetup</h1>

<p>The Berlin Compiler Meetup is an informal event focused on
discussing compiler construction, programming language design, and
related topics. It takes place about once per month.</p>

<p class="next">The next meetup will take place <u>around the middle
of July</u>.</p>

<p>We are still in the process of building this out. The date and
venue for July's event have not yet been set.</p>

<p class="list">Join the <a
href="https://groups.google.com/group/berlin-compiler-meetup">mailing
list</a> for announcements and discussion related to this meetup.</p>

<h2>Talks for the next event</h2>

<p>These are planned:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://cloudhead.io/">Alexis Sellier</a> will talk about the way the Lua compiler works.</li>
  <li><a href="http://marijnhaverbeke.nl">Marijn Haverbeke</a> will present on the syntax and macro model of his toy language.</li>
</ul>

<p>Did you study the internals of some compiler or VM? Are you working
on a toy language? Any other war stories to share? Submit a talk!
Simply write to the mailing list with your proposal. We'll schedule it
for the next meeting.</p>
