<h1>The Berlin Compiler Meetup</h1>

<p>The Berlin Compiler Meetup is an informal event focused on
discussing compiler construction, programming language design, and
related topics. It takes place about once per month.</p>

<p class="next">Next meetup: (probably) Tuesday February 19th.</p>

<p>We meet at the <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=soundcloud,+berlin&ll=52.52755,13.402904&spn=0.005855,0.016512&hq=soundcloud,&hnear=Berlin,+Germany&t=v&z=17&iwloc=A">Soundcloud office</a> <span style="color: #999; cursor: pointer" onclick="document.getElementById('info').style.display = ''">[info]</span> around 19:00.</p>

Straße 13</a> there is a big entrance to a 'Hinterhof' with a
restaurant in it. Inside this entrance, on the right, there is a
doorbell with the SoundCloud cloud logo on it. If you press that,
someone will let you in, and you can go up the stairs to the fourth
floor, where the door on the right says '<em>txtr</em>', and again has
the SoundCloud logo on it. That should be open. If not, knock. We'll
be in a room upstairs, next to the kitchen.</p>

<h2>Talks for the next event</h2>

<p>No confirmed talks yet.</p>

<p>Did you study the internals of some compiler or VM? Are you working
on a toy language? Read some mind-blowing papers on a related subject?
Any other war stories to share? Submit a talk! Simply write to the
mailing list with your proposal. We'll schedule it for the next
meeting.</p>
